# Arithmetic Geometric Mean

In mathematics, the arithmeticâ€“geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers x and y is defined as follows:

Call x and y a0 and g0:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{0}&=x,\\g_{0}&=y.\end{aligned}}}{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{0}&=x,\\g_{0}&=y.\end{aligned}}}
Then define the two interdependent sequences (an) and (gn) as

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{n+1}&={\tfrac {1}{2}}(a_{n}+g_{n}),\\g_{n+1}&={\sqrt {a_{n}g_{n}}}\,.\end{aligned}}}{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{n+1}&={\tfrac {1}{2}}(a_{n}+g_{n}),\\g_{n+1}&={\sqrt {a_{n}g_{n}}}\,.\end{aligned}}}

until a_n=b_n to the desired precision.
